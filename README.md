# YouTube-Comments-Analyzer
## Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to analyze user comments on YouTube videos to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and extract performance metrics like likes, dislikes, views, and comment count.

## Technologies Used
Python,
YouTube Data API,
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit),
pandas,
matplotlib,
Power BI.

## Working in Brief
The project gathers data from YouTube for selected videos using the YouTube Data API. Comments are analyzed using NLTK to classify them into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. Performance metrics such as likes, dislikes, views, and comment count are extracted. Finally, the analyzed data is visualized using Power BI to present sentiment distribution and correlations effectively.

## Results and Future Improvement
The project successfully analyzed over 500 user comments, providing clear visualizations of sentiment distribution and video performance metrics. Future improvements could include expanding the analysis to multiple videos, incorporating more advanced sentiment analysis techniques, and automating the report generation process for real-time insights.
